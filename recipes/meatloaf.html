        <li>4 white mushrooms, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 ½ pounds ground chuck</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup plain bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Glaze:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking
            dish with lightly greased foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place carrot, celery, onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, and garlic in
            a food processor; pulse until very finely chopped, almost to a 
            puree. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add ground chuck to the vegetables, along with Worcestershire
            sauce, egg, Italian herbs, salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Mix 
            gently with a wooden spoon until ingredients are just combined.
            Sprinkle in bread crumbs and gently mix with your fingertips until 
            just combined; don't overmix.
        </li>
        <li>
            Shape the mixture into a loaf, about 4 inches high by 6 inches 
            across. Place in the prepared baking pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven just until the meatloaf is hot, about 
            15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, stir brown sugar, ketchup, Dijon, and Sriracha for 
            glaze in a small bown until brown sugar has dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove meatloaf from the oven. Spoon glaze over the top of the 
            meatloaf with the back of a spoon, then pull a tiny bit of glaze 
            down the sides.
        </li>
        <li>
            Return to the oven, and bake until no longer pink inside, 45 to 
            75 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the 
            thickest part of the loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 
            degrees C), so start checking at 45 minutes and continue baking 
            until meatloaf reaches that temperature. Cooking time will depend 
            on shape and thickness of the loaf.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve hot and enjoy!
        </li>
