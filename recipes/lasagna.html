    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>
            Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over
            medium heat until well browned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.
            Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt,
            Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for
            about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of slightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
            noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and 
            rinse in cold water.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
            tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.            
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a
            9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat
            sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with
            1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce
            over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesean cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesean
            cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil
            with cooking spray or make sure foil does not touch cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and
            bake for an additional 25 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rest the lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
